	Brief Intro: This project was one of tasks for Interactive System Design course. The aim of project was to achieve more friendly user interface and better experience. So we tried to emulate a self service application to order menu items. 
  UI Design Principles: make the options as clear as possible and that they could be access quickly; provided feedback for every selection made by highlighting the selection and putting a mark on it.
